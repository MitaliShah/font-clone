# Functionalities
- Text typed into the custom text (type something) box should immediately change the sample text displayed in each font card.
- The sample text should return to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input (ex. input == "")
- Font size chooser should have at least four sizes and should immediately change the sample text font size in each font card.
- Implement the clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation; it should make the page appear as if the user reloaded the page (do not actually reload the page)
- Change display icon to flip between a grid and list layout for the font cards.
